# Sudoku-Project
This project originated as a fork and collaboration stemming from a group project named Sudoku.

## Overview
In this group project, a helped my team develop a simplified version of the Sudoku game. The project involves the implementation of random board generation, state checking, and visualization using PyGame. It serves as a practical opportunity to apply programming skills learned throughout the semester and gain experience working with external libraries.
